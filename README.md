I spent roughly 6 or 7 hours on this assignment. The most challenging aspect was understanding the readme, what it wanted me to do, what was already there, and how I was going to accomplish the task. Luckily my tutor was a big help in giving me a cliff notes version of the read me and I hit the ground running. I saw a great opportunity to practice switch statements which was a lot of fun. My tutor suggested I use writefilesync instead of writefile. He started off the syntax for me and I completed it. I struggled to get it to work and went back to using regular writefile. I asked my instructor the reason  for the errors and the syntax my tutor had written had the character set in the wrong position. 

I had a lot of fun with this assignment. Other than the readme, I did not find this assignment super challenging and quite enjoyed it.
